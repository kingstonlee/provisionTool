Server Problems

Issue: Disk Full
Commands Used:
  df -h
  du --max-depth 1 -h (/ directory)
  lsof -nP | grep '(deleted)'
  which named
  cat /sbin/named
  ps -ef | grep named
  kill 1454
  kill -9 1454
Problem:  A rogue script created a large file that took space and was then abruptly stopped without killing the process.  This forced the deleted file to be held by the process.
Resolution: Killed process freeing up the disk space.  Removed executable permission (sbin/named) so we can investigate further.

Issue: DNS could not reach outside box
Commands used:
  cat /etc/resolv.conf
  cp /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.20161004
Problem:  The /etc/resolv.conf was pointing to localhost for its nameserver.
Resolution: I updated the config file to match that of a working server.  Added a setup in our rudimentary provisioning management tool to ensure the resolv.conf matches.

Issue: Port 80 is in use
Commands used:
  netstat -nap | grep 80
  ps -ef | grep nc
  kill -9 1450
Problem: A netcat listener was setup to listen to port 80.
Resolution: I killed the netcat (nc) process.

Issue: Port 80 is not listening
Commands used:
  (remote host) curl 54.175.153.2:80
  (local host) curl localhost:80
  iptables -S
  iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
  iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
  iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
  iptables -F
Problem: a firewall rule '-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j DROP' was blocking port 80 from listening.
Resolution: I flushed the firewall rules to allow input port 80 to listen.
